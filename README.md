# Linear Program Solver using Two-Phase Simplex Algorithm

The matrices A, b and C (Cost Functions of Variables) are given input using the CSV files. The 0 at the start of the CSV file must be kept to ensure program to run.

Input is expected in a standard form:

min (or max)
  Cx

subject to

  Ax = b;
  x >= 0.
